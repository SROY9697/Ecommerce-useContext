## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the cloned directory)*

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, and you can usually access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (the port might vary).
